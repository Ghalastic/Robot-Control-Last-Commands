### 3. Test:

1- Create a new folder inside htdocs folder of XAMPP in the file explorer (for example, robot_control), and place all the project files (filename.php, htmlfilename.html, etc.) inside this new folder.  

2- Open a browser and go to http://localhost/htmlfilename.html.

3- Click the buttons to send commands.

4- Open phpMyAdmin, select the database that was created and connected to the php script file that displays the last commands, and browse the table that was created in the database to see the inserted commands. 

5- Open a browser and enter the URL to access your "filename.php" file. the URL would be: "http://localhost/robot_control/filename.php". and the last command will be displayed on the web page.
